Hangman-game
-------------

**Gameplay**:

Players take turns guessing letters in the word. For each incorrect guess, a part of a picture of a person being hanged is drawn. If the picture is completed, the guessing player loses. 

**Objective**:

The goal is to guess the word with as few mistakes as possible. The fewer mistakes, the higher the score. 

**Origin**:

Hangman was originally a paper-and-pencil game, but there are now electronic versions.

**Tips**:

Some tips for playing Hangman include: 
  * Guessing the most common letters first, such as e, t, a, o, i, and n 
  * Guessing the vowels first, as almost every word has at least one
